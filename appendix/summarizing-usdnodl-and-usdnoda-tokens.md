# Summarizing $NODL and $NODA Tokens

{% hint style="info" %}
**Good to know:** This protocol is multi-layered. Both tokens are of equal importance. $NODA is spent to create nodes and $NODA will be the rewards that are claimed. If you want additional reward multipliers you must put $NODL into your Node [as described here](../nodenomics/nft-node-rewards/usdnodl-level-multipliers.md).&#x20;
{% endhint %}

In the beginning market caps will vary between both tokens as game players optimize strategies unlocking our labyrinth of Nodenomics (we created this word :-). With two tokens, the supply and demand can be juxtaposed creating a discount effect for players who chase alpha. And for those that don't chase alpha and prefer to be 100% passive, it still provides more than one entry and exit strategy.

**For example:**&#x20;

If the $NODL market cap is high and the supply is being burned people may decide to take profits and convert to our $NODA token if the node token market cap is low.

And vice versa if $NODA market cap is high from many people buying to create nodes they may take profits and buy $NODL to reduce exposure to volatility. This ping pong effect will criss-cross buyers and sellers spreading them amongst both tokens preventing a single sided protocol.&#x20;

The nodenomics of both tokens will create an infinity loop providing opportunity for both early and new users while always leaving a door open for opportunists to enter the protocol depending on the fluctuations of the tokens’ market caps.

_"Assuming all people want to take advantage of a discount to maximize opportunity then we can assume $NODL holders will equal $NODA holders/node creators."_ (with a +/- 10% standard deviation for swing traders). Even if sell pressure were to increase for one coin — buying pressure will increase for one or both tokens as their prices enter a discount or premium. Additionally, $NODL will be continuously burned increasing scarcity while encouraging demand for additional rewards when claiming. In other words, as the $NODL market cap goes up the $NODL multipliers becomes more valuable and having that discount increases the value of our nodes and rewards.  &#x20;

As utility increases and market cap approaches the average — there will be an economic lag until marginal utility is realized. This realization will only happen once $NODL and $NODA reach an equilibrium becoming an average of averages.&#x20;
