# Weaknesses of Single Sided Protocols

{% hint style="info" %}
**Good to know:** Most innovative protocols are cornered by early adopters and whales. As a result, the problems that arise are liquidity and supply issues. _When large bag holders begin producing coins in excessive quantities NaaS/DaaS protocols suffer from increasing sell pressure and volatility, which harms the average user and dilutes their opportunity._ At this point the protocol has over-matured; _the rewards and price atrophy._ The next resolution is to use the treasury as a source of indirect value for the native token, innovate new services/products, decrease rewards, and heavily advertise _hoping to offset EXTREME sell pressure with new users_.   &#x20;
