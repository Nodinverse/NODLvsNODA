This is a trinary arbitrage opportunity. As the value of all 3 coins change relative to each others' price, you will likely see an arbitrage in the $NODA/$NODL pair. The simplest arb can be captured by swapping NODA for NODL or swapping NODL for NODA. The arb strategy can be expanded upon when considering the WAVAX pairs versus all the prices changes.&#x20;
