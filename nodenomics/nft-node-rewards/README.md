# NFT Node Rewards

{% hint style="info" %}
**Example:** A 10,000 node size _(@ 1.25%/day)_ will produce 125 coins per day. From here you will have the option to _collect your coin flows back to your wallet or to compound your daily coins_ which will increase your node size.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

_**$NODA Levels multiply your daily rewards and are fixed to that multiplier -> meaning your node stays at that level/tier forever and does not upgrade to next multiplier.**_\
__\
_**Once minted y**_**ou can compound to any size, but take note that you will not upgrade to higher multiplier bonuses. **_**If you want a higher tier multiplier you must mint that tier from the beginning.**_ Node Levels require a minimum amount of $NODA. There are no maximum size restrictions. &#x20;

_\*You can deposit/add as much extra $NODL or $NODA as you like to any Node Level. Once a node is minted it remains at that level forever.\*_\
\
Example: **You mint a Level 1 Node for 8000 $NODA and compound it to 34,000 $NODA in size.** Although this will have reached the Level 3 minimum, **since you minted a Level 1 Node it remains a Level 1 Node no matter what size you compound to.** _Again, if you want a higher level/tier you must mint that level from the beginning. Any node level can be compounded or deposited with as much $NODA as you like!_

Our _n_odes will pay a variable rate ranging from 0.5-4% a day. Why a variable rate? Other node protocols often use a bait and switch tactic where they offer a high daily percentage to hook you into their illiquid protocol and then suddenly decrease rewards when the daily coin flows become unsustainable.&#x20;

Why would a protocol become unsustainable? Well, if sellers (node owners that have compounded) exceed buyers (node creators) then the reward pool will dry up and break the protocol. Additionally, whales that build up a large node can capture profits at a faster rate and sell more often. Our dynamic environment and game theory with both tokens prevents these issues.&#x20;

_**Every aspect of this protocol is variable and likely to change. Change is the only constant. Nothing is fixed. No number or formula is fixed.**_

****

**The current daily rate is: 1%**

****

**To calculate your rewards it is:**&#x20;

**Node Size\*Daily rate\*NODA Tier Multiplier\*$NODL Multiplier**

**Ex. ->**&#x20;

Node: 63,000 in size&#x20;

Daily Rate: 1.25%&#x20;

$NODA **** Level 4 Multiplier: 1.08x&#x20;

$NODL Multiplier: 1.03x   &#x20;

**Math:**&#x20;

**63,000\*1.25%\*1.08\*1.03= 876 $NODA coins per day for that node!**

**Our goal is to use the variable rate as our first safety mechanism for sustainability; this will allow us to incentivize buying, selling, holding, and node creation depending on the supply/demand, market conditions, and community engagement cycle.** &#x20;
