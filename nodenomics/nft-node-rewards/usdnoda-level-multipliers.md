# $NODA Level Multipliers

_**$NODA Levels multiply your daily rewards and are fixed to that multiplier -> meaning your node stays at that level/tier forever and does not upgrade to next multiplier.**_ \
_****_\
_**Once minted y**_**ou can compound to any size, but take note that you will not upgrade to higher multiplier bonuses.  **_**If you want a higher tier multiplier you must mint that tier from the beginning.**_ Node Levels require a minimum amount of $NODA. There are no maximum size restrictions. &#x20;

You can deposit/add/compound as much extra $NODL or $NODA as you like to any Node Level. Once a node is minted it remains at that level forever.\
\
Example: **You mint a Level 1 Node for 8000 $NODA and compound it to 34,000 $NODA in size.** Although this will have reached the Level 3 minimum, **since you minted a Level 1 Node it remains a Level 1 Node no matter what size you compound to.** _Again, if you want a higher level/tier you must mint that level from the beginning. Any node level can be compounded or deposited with as much $NODA as you like!_



**Important: Our NFT NODN Nodes have a finite number of claims; on the last claim the node will be BURNED! Compound as much as you like, but plan accordingly when it comes to claiming.**

**To calculate your rewards it is:**&#x20;

**Node Size\*Daily rate\*NODA Tier Multiplier\*$NODL Multiplier**

****

**Ex. ->** Node: 63,000 in size, Daily Rate: 1.25%, Level 4 Multiplier: 1.08x, $NODL Multiplier: 1.03x   &#x20;

**Math:**&#x20;

**63,000\*1.25%\*1.08\*1.03= 876 $NODA coins per day for that node!**

**Levels (Tiers)**

1.

    8,000 $NODA = 0.5x Multiplier (Times the Daily Rate -> 0.5\*1.25%)

    **-> Claims: 11**
2.

    13,000 $NODA = 0.75x Multiplier (Times the Daily Rate -> 0.75\*1.25%)

    **-> Claims: 8**
3.

    34,000 $NODA = 1.0x Multiplier (Times the Daily Rate -> 1.0\*1.25%)

    **-> Claims: 7**
4.

    55,000 $NODA = 1.02x Multiplier (Times the Daily Rate -> 1.02\*1.25%)

    **-> Claims: 7**
5.

    89,000 $NODA = 1.08x Multiplier (Times the Daily Rate -> 1.08\*1.25%)

    **-> Claims: 7**
6.

    377,000 $NODA = 1.13x Multiplier (Times the Daily Rate -> 1.13\*1.25%)

    **-> Claims: 6**
