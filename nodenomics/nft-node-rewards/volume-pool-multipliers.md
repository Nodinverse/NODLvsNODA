# Volume Pool Multipliers

You will see the volume pool at the top of our Dapp: [https://nodn.netlify.app/](https://nodn.netlify.app)

Everything in the volume pool is from the buy and sell fees of $NODA



**The longer you hold off from claiming the greater your Volume Pool Reward Multiplier:**

2 Weeks -> 1.01x

4 Weeks -> 1.02x

6 Weeks -> 1.03x

10 Weeks -> 1.06x

20 Weeks -> 1.15x



The larger your node the greater the number of bonus rewards you receive from the volume pool when claiming.&#x20;

Volume Rewards Formula:\
\
**(Individual Node Size)/(Sum of all Existing Nodes)\*(Volume Pool Multiplier)\*(Volume Pool Size)= Proportional Claim from Volume Pool Rewards**&#x20;
