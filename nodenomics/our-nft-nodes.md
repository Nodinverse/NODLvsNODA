# Our NFT Nodes

{% hint style="info" %}
**Good to know:** Your NFT Nodes are your property. They produce coin flows similar to owning a rental property. Minimum node size will require 8,000 coins. There is no maximum size. **Every aspect of this protocol is variable and likely to change. Change is the only constant. No number or formula is fixed.**

**Your nodes have a limited number of claims. After the last claim your node will be burned. Plan accordingly as you compound, claim, and build more nodes!**&#x20;
{% endhint %}

To create a node you must spend at least 8,000 or more coins and as a result your node will produce node tokens on a daily basis (ex. \[Node Size times Daily Percentage] **8,000\*1.25% = 100 coins per day**)

Nodes are traditionally illiquid, but now that is no longer the case. Your node is now an actual piece of "digital property" with scarcity built in. Your node will be valued based on its $NODA tier, $NODL tier, total size, and number of claims.&#x20;
