# Gem Basics (NFT Nodes)

{% hint style="info" %}
**Good to know:** Minimum Gem size will require 8,000 $NODA. There is no maximum size. Every aspect of this protocol is variable and likely to change. _Change is the only constant. No number or formula is fixed._

**Your nodes have a limited number of claims and does NOT compound to the next tier (you must mint the tier you want from the beginning)!** After the last claim your node will be burned. Plan accordingly as you compound, claim, and mint more Gems!&#x20;
