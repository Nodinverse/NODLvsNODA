# $NODA Node Fees and Distributions

{% hint style="info" %}
**Good to know:** **Good to know:** Coins spent on node creation will be reallocated to protocol wallets to maintain sustainability. Claims directly to your wallet will be taxed 10% (claim tax). There is no fee for compounding. Note\* fees and distribution percentages are subject to change if necessary for the benefit of the users and protocol.&#x20;

**Whale Tax Summary**\
\
This will be for large nodes when claiming or compounding where this _**(preliminary tax) will leave additional coins in the reward pool**_ **BEFORE** anything else is calculated. Compounds will first be whale taxed and then added to the node. Therefore, claiming rewards will be whale taxed, then claim taxed, and then distributed back to the wallet.&#x20;

**Example:** \[Node: Claim after 1 Day -> 89,000\*1.5% = 1,535 $NODA -> 1535\*1% = 15 $NODA Whale Tax left in the rewards pool&#x20;

\-> This leaves 1520 $NODA to be claim taxed at 10% -> Meaning the player receives 90%\*1520= 1368 $NODA that is collected.]

**In other words, the whale tax will first leave coins in the reward pool before any other calculation;** their compounded rewards will be added after a whale tax has been deducted. And claim rewards will be collected after a whale tax and claim tax has been deducted.

Why is it calculated this way? The whale tax sustains the rewards pool in addition to the # of claims per node being limited until the last claim is used, which burns the node!&#x20;

Certified Whales with a node over 1 Million in size will have the opportunity for OTC deals, direct marketing and development proposals, utility based NFT exclusives, early exposure to complimentary protocol(s) updates, and partnership integrations.&#x20;
