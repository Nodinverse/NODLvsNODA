$NODL solves the problem of hyper-inflated rewards where $NODA can be converted to $NODL as the supply decreases. $NODL is the exit liquidity for people with nodes. Both tokens support each other as needed. **They stabilize the protocol looping inner-tokenomic systems and distributing resources so players have options can choose how they are exposed to segments of the protocol.** \
\
Traditionally, a single sided protocol has indirect value from the treasury where the only value is the supply and demand of the native node token. **We solve this problem by fractionalizing value into $NODL, $NODA, and are our nodes for precise valuations!**
