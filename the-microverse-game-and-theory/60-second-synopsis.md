1. Our NFT Nodes require $NODA and optionally accept $NODL to get a claim bonus
2. Both tokens support each other while serving different purposes
3. All percentages, rates, and number specs are variable to balance supply and demand, and ensure sustainability (ie. variables may be buffed or nerfed to balance game mechanics)&#x20;
4. $NODL is deflationary and will be burned. $NODA supply will remain fixed at 550 Million
5. Higher NFT Node ($NODA/$NODL) Levels will always provide the most competitive edge. When minting a node note that it is fixed at that level/tier and will NEVER compound to the next tier. If you want a higher tier you must buy it from the start or compound/claim enough rewards to mint a higher level &#x20;
6. NFT Nodes are scarce with a limited number of claims to prevent reward dilution
7. Players should calculate multiple game moves and potential outcomes starting with a $NODL to $NODA ratio

**Every aspect of this protocol is variable and likely to change. Change is the only constant. Nothing is fixed. No number or formula is fixed.**
