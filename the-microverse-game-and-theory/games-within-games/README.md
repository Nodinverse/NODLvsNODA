# Games within Games

{% hint style="info" %}
**Good to know:** Players will be most familiar with the common strategies in traditional node protocols. $NODL is required to optimize the $NODA Node strategy.&#x20;

Typically a single strategy dominates a node protocol where everybody buys and sells the same token. This a linear tokenomic model and in the long run will fail. \
\
The Microverse has created a variable environment with both tokens. Seasons change and new opportunities will come to the forefront. \
\
What portion of players will have 1:1 holdings of both tokens? What players will be expose 1:0 or 0:1 or 1:2 or 2:1? &#x20;
{% endhint %}

The Microverse utilizes scarce resources where the $NODL supply will continuously decrease and nodes after their last claim will be burned. _Nodes will have appreciation and depreciation effects._&#x20;

Other protocols suffer from too many nodes. Since our nodes are scarce the of claims left should always be evaluated. Additionally, the $NODL multiplier will further boost its value increasing scarcity. All players should consider these very important metrics. &#x20;

The cross pollination of multiplier effects will play into the $NODL vs $NODA market caps. This creates (entropy) games within games as players that love game theory diversify their strategies.   &#x20;
