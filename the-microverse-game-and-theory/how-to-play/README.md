# How to Play

{% hint style="info" %}
**Good to know:** Players will calculate risk considering their ratio of $NODL and $NODA. The key is to identify which token is relatively and presently more valuable. $NODL will have a decreasing supply and provide a node multiplier. $NODA supply will remain fixed and be used to mint nodes.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

**An economically rational player is one who can:**

1. Assess outcomes in the sense of rank-ordering them with respect to their desired outcome
2. Calculate paths to outcomes, in the sense of recognizing which sequences of actions are probabilistically associated with which outcomes
3. Select actions from sets of alternatives that yield the most-preferred outcomes, _**given the actions of the other players**_.

Players will find that our Dapp is very easy to use. What's different is that you are playing in a multi-dimensional landscape. -> \


**The first layer** is starts with the player assessing both of our tokens. With NODL/AVAX and NODA/AVAX in mind you will next need to consider the NODA/NODL pair on Trader Joe.&#x20;

No matter how you use the pairs above, minting a node requires $NODA and including $NODL will boost your the rewards your node produces. For highest multipliers you must use both coins.&#x20;

**The second layer** is all about how you utilize your node and allocate additional resources. Ideally, you want to compound long enough and accumulate rewards in the proper increments so that your node does not burn too fast. Claiming depreciates the value of your node (finite use) while unlocking liquidity for you use. &#x20;

**The third layer** is where the true fun starts. In this dimension all players in The Microverse interact with other players as the treasury builds, develops, and markets the protocol. The Microverse will go through cyclical seasons where changing rates will provide more opportunity for $NODL or $NODA. Players here will want to think about whether they should mint more nodes, convert $NODA to $NODL (or vice versa), or convert to AVAX (or stable).&#x20;

&#x20;**The fourth layer** is the surface layer everybody sees: The Microverse \
\-> $NODL is the deflationary inner core. $NODA is the more liquid, utility based outer core. The surface layer is the liquidity consisting of the rewards, fees, and volume to be redirected at both coins to incentivizing players and grow the effectiveness of all layers.&#x20;



Players are encouraged to explore various strategies and adapt to environmental conditions, while sharing and learning with each other. Some general strategies include: &#x20;
