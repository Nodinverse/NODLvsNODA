# Types of Players

{% hint style="info" %}
**Good to know:** Nodlers aka Players will vary in risk exposure, passivity vs active involvement, and buy vs sell vs hold vs mint vs compound vs claim. Players will dimensionally challenge others as market caps fluctuate between $NODL and $NODA. The game will experience periods of surprising entropy as adjustable variables are buffed or nerfed to bring balance to The Microverse. &#x20;

_**Expected Player Types -> Each type will have 3-8  sub-player categories and strategy preferences**_&#x20;

**The All Star Nodler:**&#x20;

Initially we expect a majority of players to strictly engage in creating nodes. This player may create 2 nodes for compounding one and claiming from the other. Other players might create 1 decent sized node and then hold a bag of node tokens on the sidelines to swing trade and/or get a quick exit for their initial ROI. This is a common strategy. Another aspect of the Nodler will be to take advantage of the $NODL coin to boost rewards.&#x20;



**The $NODL Ninjas:**

These players will very early have identified the utility of this token that will have strong deflationary pressure from burns and strong buy pressure from players wanting discounts. These players will be able to use their $NODL liquidity with greater flexibility as they time exits while also adding $NODA node exposure for passive plays. $NODL Ninjas will likely see quick positive results in the beginning and magnified results as the nodes mature and lagging tokenomics shift demand to $NODL when players identify it is undervalued. Players focused on this strategy will be able to make game decisions opposite of the majority.&#x20;



**The Supply Chain Master:**

This type of player will chase alpha. They will simulate a rags to riches supply chain starting with one node and some token resources on the sideline to scale their operation. As they understand the grind of the game system they will benefit from strong communication involving Microverse deals with other players to create win-win situations. These players will buy, supply, store, and distribute resources as they see fit. An offshoot sub-player will likely take on the role of a broker and sweep NFT Nodes on and off the market because there is no such things as infinite nodes.&#x20;



**The Raven:**

This player type will scavenge low hanging fruits. They like red candles and cheap NFT Nodes. They will be the player you want to find if you need some quick liquidity. These players are patient and indifferent about what others do. Their goal is to find as much food as possible at the cheapest price. When one door closes another one opens. Ravens will likely follow the macro cycle circulating in and out of external protocols. These players will likely compound the longest so they can maximize their entry into other aspects of The Microverse and time personal exits in real life.&#x20;



**The Effortless Sage:**

The Sage will be a hard to identify player. They will quietly stay updated without many players realizing their disguised presence or _power_. WE see ;-) This player will use all the above strategies with absolute efficiency and simplify their operation to require little maintenance. We predict these players to stick to one node in the beginning and maximize their results with the highest $NODL Tier. When they are ready to build more nodes they will use their first node to magically multiply all their resources. These players will take action instantly and in complete silence. The sage understands how to expand within multiple dimensions of the protocol. They will be incredible game theorists and likely calculate probabilities in the quantum realm.&#x20;
