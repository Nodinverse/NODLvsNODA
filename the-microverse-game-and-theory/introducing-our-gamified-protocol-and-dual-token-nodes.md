# Introducing our Gamified Protocol and Dual-Token Nodes

{% hint style="info" %}
**Good to know:** $NODL and $NODA serve as binary stars binding The Microverse. &#x20;

**Every aspect of this protocol is variable and likely to change. Change is the only constant. Nothing is fixed. No number or formula is fixed.**

The game theory mechanics allow for a great amount of entropy. Players can simply mint nodes and compound/claim for a hands-off experience. However, we encourage players that enjoy game theory to test the limits of this dynamic game environment. &#x20;



This protocol is a novel concept with our tokens distributes players from the beginning to prevent the downfalls of single sided protocol where you typically:  \
\
Buy native token to create nodes (or stake for high APY) -> Compound -> Sell Rewards -> Decrease Rewards and Market to New Users to Stabilize Price -> Continuously fight sell pressure\
\
**Both tokens serve a different purpose within our micro-ecosystem while also working together with our nodes.**&#x20;

The Microverse: $NODL vs $NODA \[A Game of Cyclical Probabilities]. This game will shift through times of chaos and order, as the two tokens battle for dominance on a quest for self-actualization where they ultimately discover that one cannot exist without the other. **The Microverse will be harmoniously polarized (remember this as you plan your game moves).**  &#x20;

Alpha will appear in between both $NODL the deflationary token and $NODA used for node creation. $NODL will be pegged to a cross-chain index of high quality DeFi protocols â€” while also pegging $NODA Nodes creating an infinity loop system. Both tokens can support the nodes as much as the nodes can support the tokens.

We refer to the above as an _infinity loop,_ which is centered around recycling, pegging, and balancing liquidity.&#x20;

We have three pairs -> NODL/AVAX, NODA/AVAX, NODA/NODL

Our nodes accept accept both tokens with different multiplier effects.

$NODL versus $NODA will present discounts that can bought reducing volatility while expanding productivity. **Similar to the lifestyle of plants; The Microverse uses these tokens creating photosynthetic and symbiotic protocol. Reduce-Reuse-Recycle.**&#x20;
