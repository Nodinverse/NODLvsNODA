**$NODA will serve as the typical token used to mint a NFT Node that produces $NODA daily.**&#x20;

_Buying $NODA requires fees_ when using Trading Joe (similar to $NODL, but still very different). These fees go to the _**Volume Pool and are bonus rewards**_ that node holders receive when claiming. This is calculated by doing (Your Node Size) divided by (Sum of All Node Size) times (Volume Pool Multiplier).&#x20;

The volume pool has its own set of [multipliers](nft-node-rewards/volume-pool-multipliers.md). All the multipliers combined with dual token nodes diversifies player strategies, which prevents a single sided protocol. For economic longevity, there must multiple on and off ramps.&#x20;



$NODA Wallet Sizes and Uses

* Nodes Reward Pool 450M
* LP 50M&#x20;
* Treasury/Marketing 55M

Note\* the Nodes Reward Pool (as seen above at 450M) is different than the bonus Volume Pool. The Volume Pool starts at 0 and increases as $NODA is bought and sold!
